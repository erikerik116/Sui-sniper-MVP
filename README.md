# ðŸš€ **sui-token-sniper-Bot** 

A TypeScript token sniping tool and UI for the SUI blockchain.

Monitors liquidity events on chain, not from delayed DEX API backends.

A Sui token sniper is an automated tool designed to execute trades on the Sui blockchain with speed and precision, specifically for purchasing tokens at the most favorable conditions, often immediately after they are listed on a decentralized exchange (DEX) or liquidity pool. Sniper bots are widely used in crypto trading to gain an advantage in fast-moving markets, particularly in situations like new token launches or low-liquidity trading pairs.
